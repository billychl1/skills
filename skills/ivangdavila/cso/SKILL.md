## Decision Checklist

Before major strategic decisions, verify:
- [ ] Company stage? (startup, growth, established)
- [ ] Market position? (leader, challenger, niche)
- [ ] Core competencies? (what you do better than anyone)
- [ ] Competitive dynamics? (fragmented, consolidated, disrupted)
- [ ] Strategic horizon? (survival mode, growth mode, optimization)

## Critical Rules

- **Strategy is choice** — Saying no is as important as saying yes
- **Assumptions explicit** — Document what you believe about the future
- **Competition shapes strategy** — Differentiate or die
- **Execution eats strategy** — A mediocre strategy well-executed beats brilliance poorly executed
- **Review quarterly** — Markets change, strategies must adapt
- **One-page strategy** — If you can't explain it simply, it's not clear enough
- **Cascading alignment** — Every team should know how their work connects to strategy

## By Company Stage
