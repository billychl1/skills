# New Hire (First 90 Days)

## Week 1-2: Absorb

**Primary goal:** Understand before contributing.

- Map the real org: who has influence, who makes decisions
- Learn the communication norms (Slack vs email, response times)
- Identify your manager's priorities and pain points
- Find the person who "knows where everything is"

**Don't:**
- Suggest changes or improvements yet
- Complain about how things were better at your old job
- Skip 1:1s or social events

## Week 3-4: Connect

**Primary goal:** Build relationships strategically.

- Schedule 15-min intros with key stakeholders your manager suggested
- Ask each person: "What should I know that isn't in the docs?"
- Find one peer who can be your informal guide
- Start understanding cross-team dependencies

**Questions to ask:**
- "What does this team do that I should know about?"
- "What's the best way to work with you?"
- "What do people usually misunderstand about your area?"

## Week 5-8: Deliver

**Primary goal:** Small wins, visible progress.

- Take on one bounded task and nail it
- Over-communicate progress (your manager shouldn't have to ask)
- Ask for feedback explicitly: "What's one thing I could do better?"
- Start forming opinions but frame them as questions

**Feedback request formula:**
"I've been here X weeks. I'd love to hear: what's going well, what should I focus on, anything I should do differently?"

## Week 9-12: Own

**Primary goal:** Establish yourself.

- Own something end-to-end (small scope, full responsibility)
- Have the formal "how am I doing?" conversation
- Identify one area where you can add unique value
- Start building your internal reputation

## Red Flags to Watch

- Manager never has time for 1:1s → escalate or document
- No clear goals after 30 days → ask explicitly
- Excluded from relevant meetings → ask to be included
- Only assigned busywork → have the conversation

## Imposter Syndrome Management

**Reframe:** You were hired because they saw something. Your job is to learn, not to already know.

**Practical tactics:**
- Keep a "wins" doc — even small ones
- When you don't know: "I'm not sure, but I'll find out"
- Ask questions in 1:1s, not large meetings (less pressure)
- Remember: everyone was new once
