# Difficult Conversation Scripts

"Quick pulse check — anything I should be doing differently?"

"I'd like to get your feedback. Specifically: what's going well, what could I improve, and is there anything I should stop doing?"

"Thanks for sharing that — as I mentioned in my [email/doc] last week, the key finding was..."

**In the moment (direct):**
"Actually, I developed that analysis. Happy to walk through my approach."

**After (private):**
"I noticed my work was presented without attribution. I'm sure it wasn't intentional, but I wanted to flag it. Going forward, can we make sure to credit contributions?"

## Pushing Back on Deadlines

**Negotiate scope:**
"I can hit that deadline if we reduce scope to [X]. Otherwise, [date] is more realistic."

**State the tradeoff:**
"I can get this done by [date], but it would mean deprioritizing [other thing]. Which matters more?"

## Declining Work

**To your manager:**
"I'd like to help, but I'm at capacity with [current priorities]. Could we discuss what to deprioritize, or can this go to someone else?"

**To a peer:**
"I can't take this on right now — I'm focused on [X]. Have you tried [person/resource]?"

**To a senior stakeholder:**
"I'd love to help with this. Let me check with [manager] on how to fit it in with current priorities and get back to you."

**After doing the work:**
"I've been focused on [achievements aligned to next level criteria]. I'd like to discuss being considered for promotion in the next cycle."

**If the answer is no:**
"I understand. Can you help me understand specifically what's missing? I'd like to have a clear path."

## Having the "What's Going On?" Conversation

When someone's behavior has changed or there's tension:

"I've noticed [specific observation]. I wanted to check in — is everything okay? Is there something I should know or something I can do?"

"I want to flag something. [Factual description of situation]. The impact is [concrete effect]. I've addressed it directly with [person], but it's continuing. I wanted you to be aware."

## Exiting a Conversation

**If it's getting heated:**
"I think we should pause and come back to this when we've both had time to think."

**If you need time:**
"This is important. Can I take some time to think about it and follow up tomorrow?"

**If it's going nowhere:**
"It sounds like we see this differently. What would help us move forward?"
