# Workplace Politics & Dynamics

## Credit Protection

**Before it happens:**
- Send written summaries after verbal discussions
- CC relevant people on progress updates
- Use "I" statements in updates: "I completed X" not "X was completed"

**When credit is taken:**
- In the moment: "Thanks for presenting that — as I mentioned in my proposal last week, the key insight was..."
- After: Private conversation first, escalate if repeated
- Document pattern if systematic

**Email trail formula:**
"Following up on our discussion — here's what I'll be doing: [your work]. Let me know if I missed anything."

## Dealing with Difficult People

### The Credit-Taker
- Always send written summaries
- Loop in witnesses
- Present your own work when possible

### The Underminer
- Don't react publicly
- Address privately once: "I noticed X. Can we align on how we communicate?"
- If continues: document and escalate with facts, not emotions

### The Micromanager
- Over-communicate proactively (remove their need to check)
- Send updates before they ask
- Ask: "What level of detail do you want on updates?"

### The Absent Manager
- Create your own structure
- Send weekly written updates
- Escalate blockers in writing with clear asks

## Building Strategic Relationships

**Map influence:** Who gets listened to? Who do decision-makers trust?

**Be useful:** Solve problems for people before they ask.

**Be visible:** Volunteer for cross-functional work that exposes you to leadership.

**Networking formula:**
1. Help someone with their problem (no ask)
2. Follow up on things they mentioned
3. Be the person who connects people
4. Only ask for something after you've given

## When to Escalate vs Let Go

**Escalate when:**
- Pattern of behavior affecting your work
- Clear policy violation
- You've tried addressing directly and it failed
- Your manager should know (they'll look bad if blindsided)

**Let go when:**
- One-time thing
- The person is leaving soon anyway
- The battle would cost more than the win
- You can route around it

## Documenting Problems

**What to document:**
- Date, time, what happened
- Who was present
- Impact on your work
- Your response

**Where:** Personal notes, not work systems. BCC yourself.

**When to use:** Only if escalation becomes necessary.
