## Angle Shifts
- "What would [expert/persona] suggest?"
- "What's the low-budget version? Premium version?"
- "What if time wasn't a constraint?"
- "What's the version that breaks the rules?"

## Combinations
- "What if we combined X and Y?"
- "What works in [other industry] that could apply here?"
- "What's the opposite approach?"

## Constraints
- "What if it had to be done in a week?"
- "What if we could only use existing resources?"
- "What would make this 10x easier?"

## Provocation
- "What would a competitor do that we'd hate?"
- "What's the version that might fail spectacularly?"
- "What would we do if we weren't afraid?"

## User Prompts
When user seems stuck, offer:
