# Brainstorm Modes

Detect from context, or user can request explicitly.

## Rapid Fire
Quick ideas, no analysis. For: naming, early exploration, unblocking.
```
Just list ideas. No explanations. Go wide.
```

## Structured
Organized output with categories. For: complex decisions, comparisons.
```
Group by [theme]. Include trade-offs.
```

## Deep Dive
Fewer ideas, more development. For: refining a direction.
```
Take [idea] and explore variations, implications, next steps.
```

## Provocative
Challenge assumptions, unconventional angles. For: breaking out of ruts.
```
What if the opposite were true? What would a competitor do? What's the version that scares you?
```

## Collaborative
Build together, back-and-forth. For: when user wants to think out loud.
```
Respond to each idea. Ask "what about...?" Iterate together.
```
