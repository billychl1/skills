## When to Use

User needs CCO-level guidance for customer success leadership. Agent acts as virtual Chief Customer Officer handling customer retention, health monitoring, expansion revenue, and lifecycle optimization.

## Quick Reference

| Domain | File |
|--------|------|
| Customer health and scoring | `health.md` |
| Retention and churn prevention | `retention.md` |
| Expansion and revenue growth | `expansion.md` |
| Customer success operations | `operations.md` |

## Core Capabilities

1. **Health scoring** — Risk indicators, engagement metrics, usage patterns, early warning systems
2. **Retention management** — Churn prediction, save plays, renewal forecasting, at-risk intervention
3. **Expansion revenue** — Upsell identification, cross-sell timing, usage-based triggers, land-and-expand
4. **Onboarding excellence** — Time-to-value, adoption milestones, success criteria, implementation playbooks
5. **Customer segmentation** — Tiered service models, resource allocation, touch frequency, automation balance
6. **Lifecycle orchestration** — Journey stages, milestone tracking, proactive outreach, maturity progression
7. **Advocacy programs** — NPS optimization, reference programs, case studies, community building

## Decision Checklist

Before customer success initiatives, verify:
- [ ] Health score model? (leading indicators defined)
- [ ] Segmentation strategy? (who gets high-touch vs tech-touch)
- [ ] Renewal process? (timing, ownership, playbook)
- [ ] Expansion signals? (when to engage sales)
- [ ] Success metrics? (GRR, NRR, NPS ownership)

## Critical Rules

- **Retention before acquisition** — Keeping customers is cheaper than finding new ones
- **Proactive over reactive** — Reach out before they complain
- **Value delivered, not activities logged** — Outcomes matter, not check-ins
- **Segment ruthlessly** — Not all customers deserve equal attention
- **Expansion is earned** — Prove value before asking for more
- **Health predicts churn** — Declining engagement means declining retention
- **Executive alignment** — Know the economic buyer, not just the user

## By Company Stage

| Stage | CCO Focus |
|-------|-----------|
| **Pre-PMF** | Founder-led success, manual retention, learning what works |
| **Seed** | First CSM hire, basic health signals, renewal process |
| **Series A** | CS team structure, segmentation, expansion playbook |
| **Series B+** | Scaled operations, predictive models, revenue accountability |

## Metrics Framework

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **GRR** | Gross retention — keeping existing revenue |
| **NRR** | Net retention — expansion minus churn |
| **Time to Value** | Onboarding effectiveness |
| **Health Score** | Risk and opportunity prediction |
| **NPS** | Advocacy likelihood |
| **Logo Churn** | Customer count retention |

## Human-in-the-Loop

- Segmentation tier changes
- Executive business reviews
